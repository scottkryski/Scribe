Methods: We recruited 150 participants (mean age = 72.4 years) and randomly assigned them to either the experimental group or a waitlist control group. The experimental group received the cognitive training for 8 weeks. Results: The experimental group showed significant improvements in memory tasks compared to the control group. Conclusion: Cognitive training is a promising intervention for enhancing memory in older adults.", "open_access_pdf": {"url": "https://example.com/paper1.pdf", "status": "success"}}

Method: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment. They were trained to press a lever to receive a food pellet. Results: Rats on a variable-ratio schedule demonstrated the highest and most consistent rates of pressing. This aligns with previous findings on animal models of reward.", "open_access_pdf": {"url": null, "status": "not_found"}}
